Step 1: Shopping cart
● You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.
● Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
● Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs
the total cost
● For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05
● Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many
candidates take a list of strings as input
